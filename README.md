This is my clone of Google's homepage. It doesn't do much else, sadly.

With this project, I hope I have demonstrated a command of the HTML and CSS front-facing tools, including but not limited to the use of external spreadsheets, coloring of the background and text, use of padding, borders, and margins, as well as positioning of elements around the page.
